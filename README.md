AWS Serverless Image Analysis Pipeline

The AWS Serverless Image Analysis Pipeline is an automated, scalable, and cost-efficient solution for processing and categorizing images using AWS serverless technologies. When an image is uploaded to an S3 bucket, the system automatically analyzes it using Amazon Rekognition (AWSâ€™s AI-powered image recognition service), categorizes it based on predefined criteria (e.g., detecting a "Dog" with high confidence), and notifies stakeholders via Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service).

#Key Features
âœ” Fully Serverless â€“ No infrastructure management required (Lambda, S3, SQS, SNS)
âœ” AI-Powered Analysis â€“ Uses Amazon Rekognition to detect objects, scenes, and labels
âœ” Automated Workflow â€“ From upload â†’ processing â†’ categorization â†’ notification
âœ” Error Resilience â€“ Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for failed message handling
âœ” Cost-Effective Storage â€“ Images automatically archived to S3 Glacier after analysis
âœ” Scalable â€“ Handles thousands of concurrent uploads with SQS buffering

#How It Works
1. Upload â€“ User uploads an image to the S3 bucket (/images folder).

2. Trigger â€“ S3 event sends a message to an SQS queue (decouples processing).

3. Process â€“ A Lambda function processes the image using Amazon Rekognition.

4. Categorize â€“ Images are moved to /analyzed/success or /analyzed/failure based on AI results.

5. Notify â€“ Results are sent via SNS (email/SMS) to the Quality Control team.

6. Archive â€“ Images transition to S3 Glacier after a retention period.

#Use Cases
1. Automated Content Moderation â€“ Flag inappropriate images in user uploads

2. E-commerce Product Tagging â€“ Auto-categorize product images

3. Wildlife Monitoring â€“ Detect specific animals in camera trap images

4. Document Processing â€“ Extract text or objects from scanned documents

#Technologies Used
1. AWS Service	Role
2. Amazon S3	Stores images and triggers processing
3. Amazon SQS	Queues upload events for reliable processing
4. AWS Lambda	Runs Python code to analyze images
5. Amazon Rekognition	AI-based image recognition
6. Amazon SNS	Sends email/SMS notifications
7. S3 Glacier	Long-term, low-cost archival

#Deployment

The entire infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform, ensuring:
âœ… Infrastructure as Code (IaC) â€“ Reproducible deployments
âœ… Secure State Management â€“ Backed by S3 & DynamoDB (for locking)
âœ… Modular Design â€“ Easy to customize (e.g., change target labels, confidence thresholds)
